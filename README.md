# SvgIconSystemNg

This project was generated with Node version 6.10.3 and [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.0   but has been ejected. Run `npm start` to serve or `npm build` to build. If you make changes to the loader, you will have to restart the app to pick up the changes.

To add icons, you just put them into the 'src/app/icon/icons' directory. The slug used for the filename must match the slug passed from the icon component.
